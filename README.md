# Official Code of Training Diffusion-based Generative Models with Limited Data (LD-Diffusion), ICML2025

Due to a busy schedule with graduation and starting a new job, I am first releasing the evaluation code and the pre-trained model trained on the 100-shot Obama dataset (See provided folder). 

The training code is currently being prepared and will be released at a later stage. We are also considering preparing a journal version of our paper. Thank you for your interest and understanding.
